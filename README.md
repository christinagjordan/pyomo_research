# Data-Driven Parameter Estimation for a Population Balance Model

### Using `Pyomo.DAE` to Fit a Dynamic Model to Experimental Polystyrene Milling Data

---

### üìã Project Overview

This project implements a dynamic population balance model (PBM) to describe the mechanochemical milling of polystyrene. The model, governed by a system of **50 Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs)**, simulates the evolution of the polymer's molecular weight distribution over time.

The core of this work involved translating a complex physical system into a computational model using **Python** and the `Pyomo.DAE` library. I then leveraged this model to solve an inverse problem: estimating key unknown process parameters directly from a limited set of experimental lab data. This approach of inferring system behavior from data is a powerful technique in modern process systems engineering and data science.

### üéØ Key Objectives

* **Model Development:** Translate the complex PBM differential equations into a robust and solvable `Pyomo.DAE` model.
* **Dynamic Simulation:** Accurately simulate the time-evolution of the polymer's mass distribution and validate it against experimental measurements.
* **Parameter Estimation:** Implement an inverse modeling framework to infer critical, unmeasurable system parameters from real-world experimental data.
* **Performance Optimization:** Re-engineer the model's formulation to dramatically reduce computational cost and solution time.

### üöÄ Results & Impact

* **Successful Parameter Inference:** The model successfully estimated key process parameters, demonstrating the ability to extract valuable insights from sparse experimental data.
* **High-Fidelity Simulation:** The final model accurately forecasted the molecular weight distribution at various time points, aligning with lab measurements.
* **80% Reduction in Computation Time:** Through strategic reformulation of the model and application of inverse modeling techniques, the simulation's computational efficiency was improved by **over 80%**, enabling faster iteration and analysis.

### üõ†Ô∏è Technology & Methodology

* **Core Libraries:** This project was developed in Python, primarily utilizing **`Pyomo`** for mathematical modeling and optimization, with its `pyomo.dae` extension for handling differential algebraic equations. **`Pandas`** was used for data manipulation and management.
* **Modeling Approach:** The population balance model tracks particle mass across 50 discrete size bins. The change in mass within each bin is described by a differential equation, creating a large, interconnected system. This system was then solved as an inverse problem to fit the model's predictions to the experimental data points.
